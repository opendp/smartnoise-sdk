# SmartNoise Synthesizers

Differentially private synthesizers for tabular data.  Package includes:
* MWEM
* QUAIL
* DP-CTGAN
* PATE-CTGAN
* PATE-GAN

## Installation

```
pip install smartnoise-synth
```

## Using

### MWEM

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

pums = pd.read_csv(pums_csv_path, index_col=None) # in datasets/
pums = pums.drop(['income'], axis=1)
nf = pums.to_numpy().astype(int)

synth = snsynth.MWEMSynthesizer(epsilon=1.0, split_factor=nf.shape[1]) 
synth.fit(nf)

sample = synth.sample(10)
print(sample)
```
### DP-CTGAN

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from snsynth.pytorch.nn import DPCTGAN
from snsynth.pytorch import PytorchDPSynthesizer

pums = pd.read_csv(pums_csv_path, index_col=None) # in datasets/
pums = pums.drop(['income'], axis=1)

synth = PytorchDPSynthesizer(1.0, DPCTGAN(), None)
synth.fit(pums, categorical_columns=pums.columns)

sample = synth.sample(10) # synthesize 10 rows
print(sample)
```

### PATE-CTGAN

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from snsynth.pytorch.nn import PATECTGAN
from snsynth.pytorch import PytorchDPSynthesizer

pums = pd.read_csv(pums_csv_path, index_col=None) # in datasets/
pums = pums.drop(['income'], axis=1)

synth = PytorchDPSynthesizer(1.0, PATECTGAN(regularization='dragan'), None)
synth.fit(pums, categorical_columns=pums.columns)

sample = synth.sample(10) # synthesize 10 rows
print(sample)
```

## Note on Inputs

MWEM, DP-CTGAN, and PATE-CTGAN require columns to be categorical. If you have columns with continuous values, you should discretize them before fitting.  Take care to discretize in a way that does not reveal information about the distribution of the data.
