    "# Preventing a Database Reconstruction Attack with Differentially Private Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Attack\n",
    "This notebook is based off of a similar [notebook](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox/blob/main/notebooks/attack_database_reconstruction.ipynb) from IBM's adversarial robustness toolkit (ART).\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses the [DatabaseReconstruction](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox/blob/main/art/attacks/inference/reconstruction/white_box.py) inference attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attack Methodology\n",
    "The attacker has access to a pretrained model trained on a full dataset, and all of the \"public\" data except a single specific missing row. This is akin to the following real world scenario: a single user requests that their data be disincluded from a dataset, and in response the data owner deletes the user's data from the public database in order to \"protect\" their information. The attack uses the given pretrained model as an estimator and infers the missing row."
